# Rookie Contract Analysis

This project is an in-depth analysis of contract value and factors that affect it in professional sports. We're using three American professional leagues for three different sports. The NFL for (American) football, the NHL for hockey, and the NBA for basketball. We're looking into relations in contract sizes between the sports, what factors affect the value of a contract, and if player positions affect value.

## Overview

This project is divided into four main sections. Three for the analyses of the three professional sports leagues, and one for drawing relations between factors that affect contract value for each sport. Each of the three league sections will conduct an EDA based approach to the question at hand by identifying what factor(s) affect the size of a player's rookie contract and subsequent contracts.

### Interesting Insight

I found that in the NHL, a player's +/- has no relation to their next contract's value. +/- is a statistic that measures the score difference when a player is on the ice. For example, if someone is on the ice when their team scores a goal, their +/- goes up by 1. I was surprised by this because the +/- statistic is often used in other sports, like the NBA, to evaluate a player's impact.

## Repo Structure

In our repo we have files that need to be downloaded if someone wishes to run our code on their device. We also have the final report saved as a qmd file and as a pdf file.
