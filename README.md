# Rookie Contract Analysis

This project is an in-depth analysis of contract value and factors that affect it in professional sports. We're using three American professional leagues for three different sports. The NFL for (American) football, the NHL for hockey, and the NBA for basketball. We're looking into relations in contract sizes between the sports, what factors affect the value of a contract, and if player positions affect value.

## Overview

This project is divided into four main sections. Three for the analyses of the three professional sports leagues, and one for drawing relations between factors that affect contract value for each sport. Each of the three league sections will conduct an EDA based approach to the question at hand by identifying what factor(s) affect the size of a player's rookie contract and subsequent contracts.

### Interesting Insight

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.
